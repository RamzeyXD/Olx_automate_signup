## About script

This script works with python Selenium webdriver and helps to automate process of registration.<br/>  

Script can be used in Linux, Windows and macOS.

## Setup

1)First of all, you need to install all requirements from requirements.txt

2)You need to install drivers for your browser.<br/>  
I use Firefox so if u want to use another browser please change:

```python
18. self.driver = webdriver.Firefox() 
```

3)Script use ruCaptcha api. You should change api token.

## Wishes

Please don't try to use this code for spaming bots or sth.
